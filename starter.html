        The header of your website is where you should place things
        like your logo, main heading/title of your site as well as
        potentially a main navigation for your website.

        this <div> acts as a wrapper and pads in the content of the site,
        so that the text doesn't run right up against the edges of the browser.
        Place the main content (text, images, etc) of your website in here.

        This website uses <strong>Ground Floor</strong> for basic HTML styling.

        You can opt-out of this style and make your own design by removing the
        "default.css" link in &lt;head> of the HTML.
