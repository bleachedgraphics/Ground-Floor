# Ground Floor
## Basic Styling of HTML elements

### What is Ground Floor?

Beyond normalizing, but not super-stylized-HTML either:

Ground Floor is the prettying up of HTML tags so that even if you never add a single class,
or touch a line of CSS your HTML won't look like a jumble of browser presets or bland looking text.


### HTML Styling

From headings to tables, forms to HTML5 elements, Ground Floor standardizes and lightly extends
basic styling for many HTML elements.

<ul>
<li>Form Elements</li>
<li>Media Elements</li>
<li>Nav Elements</li>
<li>Table Elements</li>
<li>Text Elements</li>
</ul>

### Basic Classes

The point of this framework is to give basic styling to HTML without the need for
CSS knowledge. However, for those that do have a basic knowledge of CSS and want to add a bit of extra
styling and layout structure to their websites, Ground Floor has a few basic CSS classes to extend the
standard styling.

<ul>
<li>CSS Buttons</li>
<li>CSS Layout</li>
<li>CSS Helper Classes</li>
</ul>
